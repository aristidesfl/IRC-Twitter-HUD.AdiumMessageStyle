Created from another message style I can't remember the name of.

**v0.5**  
- HUD Style
- Minimalist single line
- Primary colors scheme
- Message fade in effect
- Avatar icons, except on IRC
- Double click on Avatar icons to toggle (show username only)

**TODO:**  
- remove emoticons from IRC only (and possibly from twitter as well)
